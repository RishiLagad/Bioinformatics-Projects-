Welcome to my repository where I showcase projects from my Master's in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of South Florida. Here, you'll find detailed analyses focusing on cancer research and single-cell transcriptomics.

## Single Cell Analysis of Head and Neck Cancer (GSE139324)

### Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of head and neck cancer samples, aiming to uncover distinct cellular behaviors and gene expression patterns associated with viral and carcinogen influences.

### Data Source
The analysis is based on data retrieved from NCBI GEO:
- **Dataset ID**: [GSE139324](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139324)

### Technologies Used
- **R Language**
- **Seurat**: A package for single-cell genomics

### Scripts
- `SINGLE CELL Analysis NCBI GEO RISHI.R`: Contains all the commands for processing the GEO dataset using Seurat.

### Setup Instructions
To replicate this analysis:
1. Install R and necessary packages (`Seurat`, `Matrix`, `tidyverse`).
2. Download the dataset from NCBI GEO and adjust file paths in the script.
3. Execute the script in R.
